This repo is a bit outdated but for posterity I thought that I would move
the code to GitHub.

Most of these scripts were providing improvements to Flickr website features
in it's "old" design, before it went black. At the time Flickr was still the
cool kid on the block and a nice little community of photographers and hackers.

Some of these hacks ended up being very popular and had their own life without my contribution.
I am just posting here their initial code.

Here is a message that I sent to the flickr hacks forum on August 14, 2007.
Git wasn't very popular at the time, so this never really took off.
